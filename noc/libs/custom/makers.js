/*
* The idea of this library is to make functions that return objects that
* have:
* 1. General Attributes of objects
* 2. A reference to an object in CannonJS Physics Engine World
* 3. A rererence to an object in a 3JS Scene
*
* NOT IN THIS LIBRARY:
* - a list of objects
* - interaction logic between objects
*
* TO SUM UP:
* Basic utility like functions that accept argurment and return objects is all
* that should ever exist in this file.
